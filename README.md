Removing independent noise in systems neuroscience data using DeepInterpolation
========================

This repository is currently meant to support the bioRxiv publication results : https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.341602v1\

It contains the entirety of the code and associated data to regenerate all figures. Figure 1, 2, 4 are entirely generated in python and directly inserted as is in the paper. Figure 3 is generated in sub-panels. 

To recreate those figure, go to the figure folder and run associated python scripts. 

Data is stored in the data/ folder. Because our paper needed datasets that could not be stored on Github, we added a "local_large_data" folder under data/. The readme file in this folder provides dropxbox links to download all large data dependencies.
